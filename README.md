A Python script designed for web scraping, data integration, and NN model training. It leverages BeautifulSoup for parsing HTML content, TensorFlow and Keras for building and training models, and several other libraries for data processing and automation.

## Features

- **Comprehensive web scraping**: Scrapes not only the main content from specified URLs but also navigates and extracts data from internal links
- **Data preprocessing**: Includes text cleaning, tokenization, and sequence padding to prepare the data for model training
- **NN model training**: Utilizes TensorFlow and Keras to build and train a neural network model on the processed data
- **Automated retraining**: Uses `schedule` for automated retraining, ensuring the model stays updated with the latest web data
- **Ethical scraping**: Includes checks against `robots.txt` to ensure compliance with web standards and ethical scraping practices

## Setup and usage

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Clone the repository and don't forget to install the required packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Run the script:

```bash
python main.py
```
